# Form Builder SaaS - Project Structure

## Overview
This is a comprehensive SaaS platform for building and managing forms with a modular, scalable architecture. The project uses React with TypeScript, React Router for navigation, and implements a robust authentication and authorization system.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Principles
- **Modular Design**: Each feature is self-contained with its own components, services, and types
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict typing
- **Protected Routing**: Role-based access control with route guards
- **Scalable Structure**: Organized for easy scaling and maintenance

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication Context (`AuthContext.tsx`)
- Manages user authentication state
- Provides login, logout, register functions
- Handles user profile updates
- Uses reducer pattern for state management

### Route Guards
- **ProtectedRoute**: Ensures user is authenticated and has required roles
- **PublicRoute**: Redirects authenticated users away from public pages
- Role-based access control for admin routes

## 🛣️ Routing System

### Route Categories
1. **Public Routes**: Landing pages, marketing content
2. **Auth Routes**: Login, register, password reset
3. **Protected Routes**: Dashboard, user features
4. **Admin Routes**: Administrative functions (admin role required)
5. **Error Routes**: 404, 403, 500 error pages

### Route Configuration
- Centralized route definitions in `constants/routes.ts`
- Role-based route protection
- Automatic redirects for unauthorized access
- Nested layouts for different sections

## 🎨 Layout System

### MainLayout
- Used for public pages
- Header with navigation
- Footer with links
- Responsive design

### DashboardLayout
- Used for authenticated user pages
- Sidebar navigation
- User profile section
- Mobile-responsive sidebar

## 📊 API Integration

### API Service (`services/api.ts`)
- Centralized HTTP client
- Automatic authentication header injection
- Error handling and status code management
- Token refresh handling
- Organized by feature (auth, forms, analytics, etc.)

### Features
- Automatic 401 handling (redirects to login)
- Request/response interceptors
- Type-safe API responses
- Environment-based configuration

## 🗄️ Data Management

### Storage Utilities (`utils/storage.ts`)
- Local storage management
- Session storage utilities
- Error handling for storage operations
- Centralized storage keys

### Type Definitions (`types/index.ts`)
- User and authentication types
- API response types
- Route configuration types
- Error handling types

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ User profile integration

### API Integration
- ✅ Centralized API service
- ✅ Automatic authentication
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Type-safe responses

## 🔧 Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build
```bash
npm run build
```

## 📝 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
